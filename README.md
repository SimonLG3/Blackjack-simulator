Blackjack simulator is a project I built to improve my skills and become familiar with the C# language and the Visual Studio IDE.
It allows the user to play against the computer in an emulated game of blackjack.
Working on this project, I learnt about how the syntax in C# works, how to operate in an IDE, 
and various coding fundamentals such as while loops, for loops, incrementation, using "random" to generate randomised numbers within a specified amount, and working with lists.
